## Notice

The base code was originally cloned from https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git.  See that repository for full FTC information.

## Getting Help

The code in TeamCode was written by FTC team RoBovines 6955, if you have trouble using Stampede please contact us at team@robovines.org or create a GitHub issue.

## What is Stampede?

Stampede is a pathfinding algorithm that allows robots to drive to target positions and orientations on the field. With Stampede the robot can correct off AprilTags while in motion (unlike RoadRunner) and has a simpler calibration process. It is compatible with wheel encoders, odometry pods (three), and the optical tracking odometry sensor (otos).

## Using Stampede

To implement Stampede into your code you can either fork this repository or copy the AutoExample, Tele_Op, AngleTrackerIMU, DriveTo, and Stampede files into your code. 

Stampede uses the FTC field coordinate system.
